    "In these profiles, \"neighbourhood\" refers to the City of Toronto's 140 social planning neighbourhoods. These social planning neighbourhoods were developed by the City of Toronto to help government and community organizations with local planning by providing socio-economic data at a meaningful geographic area. The boundaries of these social planning neighbourhoods are consistent over time, allowing for comparison between Census years. Neighbourhood level data from a variety of other sources are also available through the City's Wellbeing Toronto mapping application and here on the Open Data portal.\n",

    "Each data point in this file is presented for the City's 140 neighbourhoods, as well as for the City of Toronto as a whole. The data is sourced from a number of Census tables released by Statistics Canada. The general Census Profile is the main source table for this data, but other Census tables have also been used to provide additional information.\n",
